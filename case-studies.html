      <h2>People Helping People — Volunteering Platform</h2>
      <h4>Project Overview:</h4>
      <p>"People Helping People" is a web-based platform designed to connect individuals in need of help with volunteers offering assistance. The website allows users to request and offer help for various tasks, such as mowing lawns, tech support, or helping with groceries, to name a few examples.</p>
      <h4>Why It Exists:</h4>
      <p>This idea stemmed from my professor, with the goal of teaching us what UX designers go through and the process of how to make great designs. It also aimed to show us the complexities involved in making a website accessible and thoughtful—are we adding features just to have them, or is there real business value behind each one?</p>
      <h4>Key Features:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Task Request System: Easy-to-use forms for users to request help with tasks.</li>
        <li>Volunteer Dashboard: Volunteers can filter tasks based on skills, location, and availability.</li>
        <li>Volunteer Profiles: Users can view profiles of volunteers, see their skills, and get in contact with them.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
      <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma</p>
      <h4>What I Learned:</h4>
      <p>This project taught me a lot about working in groups and managing my time, as design takes a lot of thought and consideration. I learned how to use Figma to create a design system component library. I also learned how much effort it takes to develop a website with design in mind and what stakeholders look for in a design.</p>

      <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
      <p>Vue.js, Node.js, Stripe API</p>
      <h4>What I Learned:</h4>
      <p>This project deepened my understanding of front-end development and taught me how to approach building a business and being resourceful when facing new challenges—like finding a manufacturer that doesn’t overwhelm us with costs, and choosing the right material to showcase our designs.</p>
